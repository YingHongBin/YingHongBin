# RESEARCH AND SYSTEMS

Beng Chin's research focuses on **the fundamental data and systems abstractions of modern data-driven applications**. His works attempt to lay the foundation for the design and implementation of systems (**DBxX**) that are not only efficient, robust, but also scalable and secure. Beng Chin focuses on end-to-end pipeline supporting all data processing steps, from data cleaning, through data curation with human-in-the-loop (crowd sourcing) and big data processing, all the way to complex (machine learning and deep learning based) data analytics. The work produces a large-scale cloud software system that significantly improves on prior research-focused systems, with rigorous algorithmic and theoretical results.

With the ubiquity of Big Data and fusion of applications and technologies, the projects are related in many aspects. Beng Chin approaches research problems and system design with the philosophy that all algorithms and structures should be simple, elegant and yet efficient so that they are implementable, maintainable and scalable in actual applications, and all systems must therefore be efficient, scalable, extensible and easy to use. Details of his research projects could be found in DBSystem web site.

**His view and philosophy on administration and setting up a strong database systems group** could be found in 2011 SIGMOD Record interview.
